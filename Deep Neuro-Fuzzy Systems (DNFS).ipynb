    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Data:**\n",
    "   The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using a semicolon (`;`) as the separator and a comma (`,`) as the decimal point to correctly parse the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "   Irrelevant or empty columns are dropped. All values are converted to numeric types, with invalid parsing replaced by NaN. Rows containing any NaN values are then removed to ensure clean data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "   Important features related to air quality are selected to be used as model inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Target Classification:**\n",
    "   Raw CO (carbon monoxide) values are converted into categorical air quality classes: Good, Moderate, and Poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Normalization:**\n",
    "   Features are scaled to a \\[0, 1] range using Min-Max scaling to help improve model training stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Splitting:**\n",
    "   The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\n"

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:**\n",
    "  This function prints out all the fuzzy inference rules generated by the model, showing the conditions for each input variable and the corresponding output class (\"Good\", \"Average\", \"Poor\") along with the learned weight for that rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `model`: Your trained DNFSModel instance.\n",
    "  * `terms`: The linguistic terms assigned to each membership function index (here, \"Low\" or \"High\").\n",
    "  * `variables`: Names of the input variables corresponding to each feature.\n",
    "  * `rules`: All possible combinations of membership function indices for the input variables (e.g., Low-High-Low-...).\n",
    "  * `weights`: The learned weights from the modelâ€™s output layer representing the influence strength of each rule on each output class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Generates all possible fuzzy rules as combinations of terms for each variable.\n",
    "  2. Retrieves the output layer weights from the model (converted to a NumPy array).\n",
    "  3. For each rule, builds a textual condition string that shows the fuzzy label for each input.\n",
    "  4. For each output class (quality level), prints the ruleâ€™s condition and the corresponding weight learned during training.\n"
