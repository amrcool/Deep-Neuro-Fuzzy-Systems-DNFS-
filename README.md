# Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (DNFS)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System (DNFS)**, a hybrid model that combines the human-like reasoning style of fuzzy systems with the learning capabilities of deep neural networks. The aim is to achieve robust performance on classification tasks while preserving interpretability.

## 📚 Project Description

Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Systems integrate neural networks and fuzzy logic to build intelligent systems that can **learn from data**, **reason with uncertainty**, and **generalize** well on unseen data. This project is implemented using PyTorch and other scientific Python libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully implemented Neuro-Fuzzy architecture using PyTorch
- Min-Max normalization of dataset
- Custom training loop and evaluation metrics
- Visualizations of performance and confusion matrix
- Detailed classification report
